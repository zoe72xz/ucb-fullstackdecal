    <h2>History</h2>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>Robin Buckley was supposedly conceived by Richard and Melissa Buckley in the back of a VW van on 
        the Oregon Coast one evening.Born March 10, 1968, Robin was raised in the small town of Hawkins, 
        Indiana. She mentions being in a variety of extracurricular activities in her youth, including 
        playing the French horn in band since she was five years old; she also learned to play the trumpet 
        at an unknown point. Robin played on the soccer team, and acquired fluency in French, Italian, 
        Spanish and Pig Latin, and learned small bits of Russian. At some point while playing soccer, her 
        team's goalie, Beth Wildfire, was injured when another player slid into her knee and caused the 
        bone to stick out of it. 
        <br><br>By 1983, Robin began attending Hawkins High School, where she was labeled a band dweeb. 
        She knew of students such as Nancy Wheeler (who she labeled a priss) and Steve Harrington (who 
        she labeled a douchebag), though neither one of them would acknowledge her existence.
        <br><br>On November 6, 1983 - the day Will Byers disappeared - Robin heard a "monstrous" noise at 
        night, prompting her to quickly cycle back home while singing a song to calm her nerves.
        <br><br>Shortly after the presumed death of Will Byers and the disappearance of Barbara Holland, 
        Robin was starting to show signs of dissatisfaction with her life in Hawkins. Feeling fed up, 
        Robin devised a plan called "Operation Croissant" with the intention of fleeing Hawkins and starting 
        a new life in Europe.
        <br><br>One day she heard a reminder through the school PA system about the memorial for Will Byers, 
        which she paid little attention to. After leaving class, she asked permission from her teacher 
        Mr. Hauser if she could hang out at his room to help stave off her onset of nervousness. Mr. Hauser 
        humored her, letting her practice her French lessons which she was reciting to herself. They soon got 
        into a discussion about life in Hawkins and the current events. According to Robin, it was her theory 
        that Barbara Holland had actually ran away from Hawkins.
        <br><br>Around 1984, in Robin's sophomore year, she was placed in Ms. Click's (or as she and her 
        bandmates referred to her as "Mrs. Clickity Clackity") first-period History Class on Tuesdays and 
        Thursdays, where she sat behind Steve himself. Over the course of the class, Robin grew to hate Steve 
        for his tardiness, negligence to notice her, gross eating habits of getting crumbs of his bagel 
        sandwich all over the floor, his frequency to ask dumb questions, and especially his cocky behavior. 
        But what infuriated Robin the most was that her crush, Tammy Thompson, was obsessed with Steve, 
        despite him not being interested in her, and would often cause Robin to go home and scream into her 
        pillow.

    <h3>1985 Working at Scoops Ahoy</h3>
    <p>When the Starcourt Mall opened in 1985, Robin got a job at the Scoops Ahoy. Steve Harrington was forced 
        by his father to also get a job at the ice cream parlor due to not having the grades to attend college. 
        Robin still held animosity towards Steve from his years in high school and would often tease him from 
        due to his constant failure to pick up girls, often referring to him as "Dingus".
        <br><br>On June 28, Steve's younger friends Mike Wheeler, Lucas Sinclair, Max Mayfield, and Will Byers 
        arrived at Scoops Ahoy, requesting Steve. Robin informed her co-worker that his "children" were here. 
        When the power at the mall suddenly went out, Steve repeatedly tried to get the lights back by flicking 
        the light switch on, much to Robin's annoyance. However, the lights went back on and Robin went back to 
        work with Steve.
        <br><br>The next day, when Steve repeatedly attempted to (unsuccessfully) pick up dates while on the job, 
        Robin poked fun at him, running a tally of his successes and failures on a whiteboard labeled "You rule; 
        You suck" while calling him a "dingus". Robin also mocked him for having to wear a sailor hat which he 
        believed was the reason he was failing to get a date where he decided to take it off. When Steve again 
        tried to pick up another date, Robin, in disgust, put another tally under "You suck" board behind Steve's 
        back.

    <h3>1985-1986 A new romantic interest</h3>
    <p>By the autumn season, Robin became a senior in high school. As Tammy Thompson had graduated from high school, 
        Robin moved on from her and started to become romantically interested in her classmate and fellow band mate 
        Vickie. Her crush on Vickie was noticed by Steve and despite his support, Robin was unsure to pursue Vickie 
        and how to act around her, as she did not know if Vickie would be attracted to her.
        <br><br>
    </p>
    <h3>1986 Falling in Love</h3>
    <p> On the last day of school before spring break, March 21, Robin carpooled with Steve as she applied on some 
        makeup to get ready for a basketball pep rally. As Robin applied her makeup, she barely paid attention to 
        Steve voicing his disapproval of committing a relationship with a girl that only involved having sex. Robin 
        simply told Steve his love life was getting more complexed due to him getting tons of dates from female 
        customers while working at Family Video. As Robin continued to get ready for the pep rally, she denied to 
        Steve about being concerned with impressing Vickie. Though Robin stated did not know for sure what Vickie's 
        sexuality was, Steve advised her to pursue Vickie, believing her to be the right girl and a lesbian, due to 
        having paused and returned the movie Fast Times at Ridgemont High at fifty-three minutes and five seconds, 
        much to Robin's disgust.
        <br><br>After their talk, Robin was dropped off at Hawkins High School by Steve who then left to go work 
        at Family Video.
