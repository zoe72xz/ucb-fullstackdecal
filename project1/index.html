    <h2>Basic Intro</h2>
    <p>Hey there — I’m Zhu.

        A student, a risk-taker I would say, a life-based travel journalist, and (probably) a wellness devotee, a news nerd to-be.
        
        I was born and raised in Shanghai, now living in Hong Kong, and may usually drop by Singapore, Beijing and central Szechuan province, China.
        
        I love talking to people, and love mo lei tau (無厘頭) silly little things. Welcome to connect if some baka stuff like roo balls gift packs sounds interesting to you. Or we can chat about job and workplace, if you want. I had some experience in innovation, incubation and investment too.
        
        I also do tennis, roller skating and coding.</p>
    <h4>Zhu's professional experiences</h4>
    <p>Zhu is an undergraduate at HKU dual-majoring in Journalism and Finance, having internship experiences with Caixin Global, Miracleplus (former Y Combinator China), Reuters News Agency, Fosun Capital, etc.

        Their roles involve economics news reporting, investment research and international project management. They also engaged with many tech founders and learnt about product design.
        
        They talk to people a lot, take photos, shoot films, write and code. Though they also helped plan several multinational events which are claimed to be high-end, they hate to, because they hate suits — the discomfort of ill-fitting wearings can make them forget how delightful the food usually is at such events.
        
        On a personal level, they also trade stocks, and they only love to trade their own portfolio. So they don’t consider any fund manager jobs, neither do they invest in any actively-managed funds.

            <p><b>The Gap To Fill</b></p>
            <p>University students are stressed in recent years due to various reasons, leading to an increasing number of university students to start a year of experiential learning or personal interest development away from school in order to find their “real self”. This is an individual assignment.</p>
